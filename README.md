# About 

Swolelog is a weightlifting journal for tracking your strength progress for the classic compound movements: barebell squat, bench press, strict barebell press, deadlift, and barebell row. 

Built using Ruby on Rails to handle the backend, user authenthication, and provide a RESTful Api. For the Front End, all asynchronous HTTP calls are using the fetch API and JavaScript. 

To provide a more seam-less user interface, I am using classList.toggle on each element to hide and show exercise sets and data. 

The navbar and form buttons are all using the Bootstrap framework.
