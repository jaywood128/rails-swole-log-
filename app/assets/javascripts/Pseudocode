If they have no workouts entered, then see the "Start New Workout" button. After, then click the button. 
They click the "Add WorkoutLift" --- change to "Choose an exercise" --- form and select the exercise from 
the drop down. 
Then they click the submit button and the WorkoutLift name is added to database. 
Then the user will see that lift added, eg. "Bench Press" and a button bellow that to "Add workout info".
The User will only see the show exercise sets button -- the one with the down arrow -- if they have 
exercisesets.

Use a control that togglees the set data to either reveal it or hide it. 
The default state hides all the exercise set data is hidden -- id called #hide-me. 

Problem: I don't want to show the down arrow icon for an exercise if it doesn't have any exercise sets. 
Possible Solution: Add attribute to WorkoutLift on the backend called has_exercise_sets. When created, set it 
to false. 

When exercise_sets for a workout are submitted via HTTP request, set it to true inside the exercise_sets 
controller's create action. 
Then, inside displayWorkout function, if the WorkoutLift's has_exercise_sets attribute is false, 
don't add the showExerciseSets button with down arrow.
